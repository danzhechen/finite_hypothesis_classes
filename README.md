# finite_hypothesis_classes

Finite hypothesis classes refer to a set of candidate hypotheses (functions) for modeling data that is finite in size. Each hypothesis represents a possible way of predicting the outputs 𝑌 given the inputs 𝑋. In this context, I will work with finite hypothesis classes to solve a supervised learning problem using the MNIST dataset.
